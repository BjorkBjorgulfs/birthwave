This is a school project in Vefsk√≥linn.
It's a project in module 7, first I did some research about 
client and server components in Next.js and when it's best to use them.

After researching I made a simple website using Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind, Supabase and Prisma.
(I will try and make a live version with Vercel)

the project is not at all ready, the home page and contact page are working.
